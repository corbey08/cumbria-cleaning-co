                <h2>7. Limitations and Warranties</h2>

                <h3>7.1 Satisfaction Guarantee</h3>
                <p>We guarantee your satisfaction with our work. If you are not completely satisfied, we will return to re-clean the affected area at no additional charge within 7 days of the original service.</p>

                <p>While we use advanced techniques and equipment, we cannot guarantee the complete removal of all stains. Some stains may be permanent due to age, previous treatment attempts, or the nature of the staining substance.</p>

                <h3>7.3 Colour Fastness</h3>
                <p>We test for colour fastness where possible, but cannot guarantee against colour bleeding or fading in fabrics that are not colourfast.</p>

                <h3>7.4 Pre-existing Damage</h3>
                <p>We are not liable for pre-existing damage, wear, or defects that become apparent during or after cleaning.</p>

                <p>We may cancel or reschedule appointments due to severe weather, equipment failure, or other circumstances beyond our control. We will provide as much notice as possible and reschedule at your convenience.</p>

                <h2>10. Health and Safety</h2>
                <p>We comply with all relevant health and safety regulations. Our cleaning products are safe for use around children and pets when used as directed.

                <h2>13. Force Majeure</h2>
                <p>We are not liable for delays or failure to perform due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to severe weather, natural disasters, or government restrictions.</p>

                <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>

                <h2>16. Severability</h2>
