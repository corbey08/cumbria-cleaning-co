I spoke with Tod who gave me a great price and his knowledge was outstanding as I was concerned about the products being OK with me having a dog, as others I called could not offer me that guarantee. He booked me in straight away and wow my carpets look amazing best they have in years and they smell lovely. I can't express enough how professional he is and my dog loved him."
